# Mattermost Connector

AxonIvyâ€™s mattermost connector helps you to accelerate process automation initiatives by integrating Mattermost features into your process application within no time. This connector:

- Gives you full power to the [Mattermost's APIs](https://api.mattermost.com/).
- Allow you to start the AxonIvy process by hitting the slash command key from the mattermost's channel.
- Allow you to send a message to the mattermost's channel from the AxonIvy workplace.
- Notifies users on the channel for new AxonIvy workflow Tasks.
- Supports you with an easy-to-copy demo implementation to reduce your integration effort.

## Demo

1. Hit the slash command key on the channel's chat.
The Axon Ivy process will be triggered and create a new task.
The task's information will be sent to the channel by a message.
